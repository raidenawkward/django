ClientCookie installation instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Python 2.0 or above is required, and urllib2 is recommended.  Python
2.0 and above have urllib2 in the standard library, but the version of
urllib2 supplied with Python 2.0 is too old.  If you're using Python
2.0, get the version from Python 2.1 (available from the source
distribution or CVS from http://www.python.org/).

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

To install the package, run the following command:

 python setup.py build

then (with appropriate permissions)

 python setup.py install


Alternatively, just copy the whole ClientCookie directory into your
Python path (eg. unix: /usr/local/lib/python2.2/site-packages,
Windows: C:\Python21, or C:\Python22\Lib\site-packages).  That's all
that setup.py does.  Only copy the ClientCookie directory that's
inside the distributed tarball / zip archive, not the entire
ClientCookie-x.x.x directory!


To run the functional tests (which DO access the network):

 python functional_tests.py

To run the unit tests (which DO NOT access the network):

 python test.py

This runs the unit tests against the source files extracted from the
package.  To run them against the installed copy of ClientCookie:

 python test.py -i

For help on other unit test options:

 python test.py --help


If you're using a pre-2.1 version of Python, you'll need to get
unittest.py (from http://pyunit.sourceforge.net) to run the tests.

If you run the tests on an Apple, or other non-unix, non-Windows
machine, please mail me the output along with details of the system
you ran them on.
